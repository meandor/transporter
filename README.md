# Transporter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meandor/transporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meandor/transporter)

A _Scala-Application_ that transports matter to locations using [Akka](https://akka.io/)
and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics.

In other words it exports data to other locations. It can be used to export data to APIs. 
It accepts incoming data via REST.

## Configuring

To change configs like the port the HTTP server is listening to and similar,
change the `application.conf` file.

## Testing
Execute the tests with gradle:
```bash
./bin/go check
```

## Building
To build with gradle:
```bash
./bin/go clean distZip
```

This will create a zip file under `./build/distributions/`

Unzip it and then execute the application within the extracted folder:
```bash
./bin/transporter
```

## Build docker image
To build a docker image called "transporter":
```bash
./bin/go dockerize
```

## Incoming Data
Add interfaces for dealing with incoming data at `de.meandor.transporter.console.TransporterConsole`
by registering [Akka-HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/) routes.

## Outgoing Data
Register an Akka-Actor with the system for each location you want to transport to.
For that just add new `de.meandor.transporter.platform.Platform`s at `de.meandor.transporter.Transporter`.

Each Platform consists of a `PhaseTransitionCoil` and a `TargetingScanner`.
The `PhaseTransitionCoil` is responsible for transforming matter to energy or in other
words transform incoming data (e.g. entity) into data that can be exported (e.g. DTO).

The `TargetingScanner` is responsible to lock onto the target depending on the given location.
In other words find the proper API abstraction to export to (adapter), which is called `Target`.

To add an Export you have to add a new `Platform` actor with an mplementation of
`PhaseTransitionCoil` and `TargetingScanner` which define how to export incoming data.

In `de.meandor.transporter.Transporter`:
```scala
...
implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("Transporter")
implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()
implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContext = system.dispatcher

system.actorOf(Platform.props(SpecificPlatformPTC, SpecificPlatformTS), "SpecificPlatformName")
...
``` 

where `SpecificPlatformTS` and `SpecificPlatformPTC` tell the Platform how to beam Matter.
```scala
object SpecificPlatformTS extends TargetingScanner {  
...
}

object SpecificPlatformPTC extends PhaseTransitionCoil {  
...
}
```

## Example
There is a package called `de.meandor.transporter.example` where you can see an example of how to
add a transportation process.

## Metrics
Prometheus metrics are exported to the HTTP server via the `/metrics` endpoint.
